This month, I moved my family to Sydney. The story is very simple: about three years ago, when I was browsing [cnblog](http://www.cnblogs.com), I found this [post](http://www.cnblogs.com/unruledboy/archive/2012/07/23/australia2yearanniversary.html) talking about moving to Australia.

So I asked my wife:" how about moving to Australia? "

" How? "

" By Skilled Migration Program. "

Big thanks to [FreeOZ](https://www.hioz.im) and [FLYabroad](http://www.flyabroadvisa.com/).

Now, I am setting in a bedroom in Sydney writing this blog.

It is a kind of completely new life style now. I need to find new job as soon as possible and get used to speaking, writing and thinking in English.

A significant benefit living outside of China is that I can access any website without a ladder. This is very important for a programmer :-)
